# How to avoid specifying gender in a family form?

## The issue

On a family form we've got:

    Her Name:
    His Name:
    Her Profession:
    His Profession:

How to keep a readable form without specifying gender?

## The goal

Support single parent (avoiding empty fields) and any gender combination.

## Proposed solution

The revised form could look like:

    Name:
    Profession:
    
    + Add partner details
